Billiard systems have been used extensively in mathematics, nonlinear dynamics and chaos and played an important role in the development of nonlinear science.\n\n\nThe above will be referred to as the \"standard\" billiard. The \nwikipedia page\n has many examples of different types of billiards. Also, the \nscholarpedia\n entry is a good read on the subject. In general, the standard billiard can be extended in many ways.\n\n\nThe types that are currently offered by this package, besides the standard one, are magnetic and ray-splitting billiards. In a magnetic billiard the particle's orbit is a circle (like electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field). In ray-splitting (a.k.a. semiclassical) billiards the particle may propagate \nthrough\n an obstacle, given some arbitrary transmission and refraction law.\n\n\nThis package does not support finite-sized particles and, as a result, there is also no support for collision between particles.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\n\n\nThis package is registered, simply use \nPkg.add(\"DynamicalBilliards\")\n to install it.

            "text": "Basic Usage\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n was created with easy-of-use as its main cornerstone. With 3 simple steps, the user can fully initalize, evolve, and get the output of the propagation of a particle in a billiard system.\n\n\nIn general, the workflow of \nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n follows these simple steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a billiard table, a \nVector{Obstacle}\n.\n\n\nCreate a particle inside that billiard table.\n\n\nGet the output by evolving the particle.\n\n\n\n\nAdding more complexity in your billiard table does not add complexity in your code. For example, to implement a ray-splitting billiard you only need to define one additional variable, a dictionary \nDict{Int, Vector{Function}}\n. After reading through this basic usage page, you will be able to use all aspects of \nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n\nStraight Propagation\n\n\n\n\nThe usage of this package revolves around a single function:\n\n\nevolve!\n(\np\n::\nAbstractParticle\n,\n \nbt\n::\nVector\n{\nObstacle\n},\n \nt\n::\nUnion\n{\nInt\n,\n \nFloat64\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich evolves a particle \np\n inside a billiard table \nbt\n. If the given \nt\n is of type \nFloat64\n, the evolution happens for \nt\n amount of time. If however \nt\n is of type \nInt\n, the evolution happens for \nt\n number of collisions (other types are not supported).\n\n\nThe first step is to define the billiard table \nbt\n, which is the system the particle \np\n will propagate in. A billiard table is simply a collection (\nVector\n) of \nObstacle\ns. The most convenient way is to use one of the pre-defined billiard tables offered by the package. For example, let's create a periodic Sinai billiard with disk radius of 0.3 and with one side of length 2 and one of length 1:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nbt\n \n=\n \nbilliard_sinai\n(\n0.3\n,\n \n2.0\n,\n \n1.0\n;\n \nsetting\n \n=\n \nperiodic\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(for more information about defining billiard tables visit the \ntutorial on defining your own billiard table\n)\n\n\nAfterwards, you want to create a particle inside that billiard system. For that, the function \nrandominside(bt::Vector{Obstacle})\n is provided, which returns a particle with random initial conditions inside the billiard table.\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to specify the initial conditions yourself, simply pass them to the \nParticle\n constructor, like \np = Particle(x0, y0, \u03c60)\n. Now you are ready to evolve this particle:\n\n\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n \n=\n \nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n1000.0\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe behavior of \nevolve!\n depends on the type of the third argument, which represents total amount. If it is \nFloat64\n, it represents total amoount of time, but if it is \nInt\n it represents total amount of collisions.\n\n\n\n\nThe return values of the \nevolve!()\n function need some brief explaining: As noted by the \"!\" at the end of the function, it changes its argument \np\n. Most importantly however, this function also returns the main output expected by a billiard system. This output is a tuple of three vectors:\n\n\n\n\nct::Vector{Float64}\n : Collision times.\n\n\nposs::Vector{SVector{2}}\n : Positions during collisions.\n\n\nvels::Vector{SVector{2}})\n : Velocities \nexactly after\n the collisions (e.g. after reflection).\n\n\n\n\nThe time \nct[i]\n is the time necessary to reach state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n starting from the state \nposs[i-1], vels[i-1]\n. That is why \nct[1]\n is always 0 since \nposs[1], vels[1]\n are the initial conditions.\n\n\nIf this output is not convenient for you, the function \nconstruct(ct, poss, vels)\n is provided, which constructs the (continuous) timeseries of the position and velocity, as well as the time-vector, when given the main output of \nevolve!()\n:\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor, by taking advantage of the awesome ellipsis operator, you can do:\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n100.0\n)\n...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic Propagation\n\n\n\n\nThe are only two differences between magnetic and straight propagation. Firstly, the particle type is not \nParticle\n anymore, but \nMagneticParticle\n. The latter has an extra field called \nomega\n which is the cyclic frequency of rotation (equivalently, the angular velocity). In order to create a \nMagneticParticle\n (without using the constructors), you simply provide this extra information to the \nrandominside()\n function:\n\n\n\u03c9\n \n=\n \n0.5\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\ntypeof\n(\np\n)\n \n# MagneticParticle\n\n\np\n.\nomega\n   \n# 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo propagate the particle you use the same functions:\n\n\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n,\n \n\u03c9\n \n=\n \nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n1000.0\n)\n  \n#evolve for magnetic also returns \u03c9\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n,\n \n\u03c9\n,\n \ndt\n)\n\n\n# or equivalently:\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n1000.0\n)\n...\n,\n \ndt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the second difference is that the additional argument of the angular velocity must also be provided to the \nconstruct()\n function, in order for it to construct circular motion instead of straight motion between collisions. (Note: \nevolve!()\n returns 4 arguments for magnetic propagation, making the ellipsis syntax extremely useful!).\n\n\nThe final optional argument \ndt\n is the time-step at which the timeseries are constructed (since they are made up of sines and cosines).\n\n\n\n\nRay-Splitting\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how complex ray-splitting processes you want, and irrespectively of how many obstacles in the billiard table can perform ray-splitting, there is only a single difference on the main function call: The \nevolve!()\n function is supplemented with a fourth argument, called \"ray_splitter\":\n\n\nray_splitter\n::\nDict\n{\nInt\n,\n \nAny\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis argument is simply a dictionary which handles all ray-splitting processes in the billiard system. It is a map of the Obstacle index within the billiard table a container of the ray-splitting functions: (\u03c6 is the angle of incidence)\n\n\n\n\nT(\u03c6, where, \u03c9) : Transmission probability.\n\n\n\u03b8(\u03c6, where, \u03c9) : Transmission (aka diffraction) angle.\n\n\nnew_\u03c9(\u03c9, where) : Angular velocity after transmission.\n\n\n\n\nAssuming you have defined a billiard table and a ray-splitter dictionary, the implementation is exactly the same as in the two previous cases: the ray-splitting dictionary is passed to \nevolve!()\n as a fourth argument.\n\n\nray_splitter\n \n=\n \nDict\n(\n5\n \n=\n \n(\nfoo\n,\n \nbar\n,\n \nbaz\n))\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n,\n \n4.0\n)\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n100.0\n,\n \nray_splitter\n)\n...\n,\n \n0.01\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information and instructions on defining the \"ray_splitter\" dictionary visit the \nRay-Splitting tutorial here\n.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing\n\n\n\n\nThe functions \nplot_obstacle(obst::Obstacle; kwargs...)\n, \nplot_billiard(bt::Vector{Obstacle})\n and \nplot_particle(p::AbstractParticle; kwargs...)\n are provided in order to plot the respective elements \non the current PyPlot figure\n. The \nkwargs...\n are keywords passed directly into \nPyPlot\n's constructors (like e.g. \nlinewidth = 2.0\n).\n\n\nThe tutorial on visualizing\n has step-by-step descriptions on how to handle all plotting offered by \nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction animation\n\n\nThe example .gif shown in the introduction, was generated simply with the code:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n,\n \nPyPlot\n\n\n\nbt\n \n=\n \nbilliard_rectangle\n(\n1.5\n,\n \n1.0\n)\n\n\nd1\n \n=\n \nDisk\n([\n0.45\n,\n \n0.6\n],\n \n0.3\n,\n \nUpper-left Disk\n)\n\n\nd2\n \n=\n \nDisk\n([\n1.1\n,\n \n0.3\n],\n \n0.15\n,\n \nLower-right Disk\n)\n\n\nd3\n \n=\n \nDisk\n([\n1.2\n,\n \n0.8\n],\n \n0.1\n,\n \nSmall Disk\n)\n\n\nw1\n \n=\n \nFiniteWall\n([\n0.0\n,\n \n0.4\n],\n \n[\n0.6\n,\n0.0\n],\n \n[\n0.4\n,\n0.6\n],\n \nDiagonal\n)\n\n\npush!\n(\nbt\n,\n \nd1\n,\n \nd2\n,\n \nd3\n,\n \nw1\n)\n\n\n\u03c9\n \n=\n \n2.0\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n\nplot_billiard\n(\nbt\n)\n\n\naxis\n(\noff\n)\n\n\ntight_layout\n()\n\n\n\nsname\n \n=\n \nC:\n\\\\\n***\n\\\\\nexample\n\n\nplot_evolution\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n200\n;\n\n\ncol_to_plot\n \n=\n \n4\n,\n \nsavefigs\n \n=\n \ntrue\n,\n \nsavename\n \n=\n \nsname\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards the outputed .png files where merged into a single .gif externally using for example the website gifmaker.me.",

The abstract Type \nObstacle\n is the supertype of all objects that a particle may collide with.\n\n\nThere are many premade functions that construct well-known billiards, like the periodic Sinai billiard. You can find all of them at the \nStandard Billiards page\n.\n\n\nTo create a custom billiard, you start with an empty Vector:\n\n\nbt = Obstacle[]\n\n\n\n\n\nand then you create your obstacles one by one and add them to it. All obstacles that are already defined in the package can be found at the \nObstacles page\n of the library. The function \nbilliard_polygon\n creates a polygonal billiard table.  However, for the example of this page, we will create a hexagonal billiard with a disk in the middle step-by-step.\n\n\nThe first step is to define the six walls of the billiard table. A \nFiniteWall\n object needs to be supplemented with a start point, an end point, a normal vector and, optionally, a name. The vertex points of a regular hexagon of radius \nr\n are given by the formula:\n\n\n$$\n(x,y) = \\left( r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right), r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right) \\right)\\,, \\quad \\text{for i $\\in$ {1,...,6}}\n$$\n\n\nTo create each wall object, we will implement the following loop, choosing a size of 2.0:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nhexagon_vertex\n \n=\n \n(\nr\n)\n \n-\n \n[\n \n[\nr\n*\ncos\n(\n2\n\u03c0\n*\ni\n/\n6\n),\n \nr\n*\nsin\n(\n2\n\u03c0\n*\ni\n/\n6\n)]\n \nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \n1\n:\n6\n]\n\n\nhexver\n \n=\n \nhexagon_vertex\n(\n2.0\n)\n\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \neachindex\n(\nhexver\n)\n\n  \nstarting\n \n=\n \nhexver\n[\ni\n]\n\n  \nending\n \n=\n \nhexver\n[\nmod1\n(\ni\n+\n1\n,\n \nlength\n(\nhexver\n))]\n\n  \nw\n \n=\n \nending\n \n-\n \nstarting\n\n  \nnormal\n \n=\n \n[\n-\nw\n[\n2\n],\n \nw\n[\n1\n]]\n\n  \nwall\n \n=\n \nFiniteWall\n(\nstarting\n,\n \nending\n,\n \nnormal\n,\n \nwall \n$i\n)\n\n  \npush!\n(\nbt\n,\n \nwall\n)\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nnormal\n vector of a \nWall\n obstacle is necessary to be supplemented by the user because it must point towards where the particle is expected to come from. If \nw\n is the vector (wall) pointing from start- to end-point then the vector \n[-w[2], w[1]]\n is pointing to the left of \nw\n and the vector \n[w[2], -[w1]]\n is pointing to the right. Both are normal to \nw\n, but you have to know which one to pick. In this case this is very easy, since the normal has to simply point towards the origin.\n\n\nWe add a disk by specifying a center and radius (and optionally a name): \n\n\nd\n \n=\n \nDisk\n([\n0\n,\n0\n],\n \n0.8\n)\n\n\npush!\n(\nbt\n,\n \nd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure the billiard looks as you would expect, use the function \nplot_billiard(bt)\n.

This is either the angular velocity of the particle (\nFloat64\n), or in the case of ray-splitting it is a vector of the angular velocities at each time step (\nVector\n).\n\n\nThe time \nct[i]\n is the time necessary to reach state \nposs[i+1], vels[i+1]\n starting from the state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n. That is why \nct[1]\n is always 0 since \nposs[1], vels[1]\n are the initial conditions. The angular velocity \n\u03c9[i]\n is the one the particle has while propagating from state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n to \ni+1\n.\n\n\nNotice that at any point, the velocity vector \nvels[i]\n is the one obtained \nafter\n the specular reflection of the (i-1)th collision.

Function .  resolvecollision!(p::AbstractParticle, o::Obstacle)  Resolve the collision between particle  p  and obstacle  o , depending on the type of  o .  resolvecollision!()  takes special care so that the particle is always inside the correct side of the billiard table, in order to avoid particle leakage.  resolvecollision!(p, o, T::Function, \u03b8::Function, new_\u03c9::Function)  This is the ray-splitting implementation. The three functions given are drawn from the ray-splitting dictionary that is passed directly to  evolve!() . For a calculated incidence angle \u03c6, if T(\u03c6)   rand(), ray-splitting occurs.  source  #  DynamicalBilliards.specular!     Function .  specular! ( p :: AbstractParticle ,   o :: Obstacle )   Perform specular reflection based on the normal vector of the Obstacle.  In the case where the given obstacle is a  RandomObstacle , the specular reflection randomizes the velocity instead (within -\u03c0/2 to \u03c0/2 of the normal vector).  source  #  DynamicalBilliards.periodicity!     Function .  periodicity! ( p :: AbstractParticle ,   w :: PeriodicWall )   Perform periodicity conditions of  w  on  p .  source  #  DynamicalBilliards.collisiontime     Function .  collisiontime ( p :: AbstractParticle ,   o :: Obstacle )   Calculate the collision time between given particle and obstacle.  The funtion chooses the appropriate method depending on the type of particle (magnetic or not) as well as the type of the obstacle. Returns the time that the particle, given its current position and Type, must be propagated to reach the collision point. This time can be given directly to  propagate!(p, time)  which brings the particle to the collision point.  In the case of magnetic propagation, there are always two possible collisions. The function internally decides which of the two will occur first, based on the sign of the angular velocity of the magnetic particle.  source  #  DynamicalBilliards.propagate!     Function .  propagate! ( p :: AbstractParticle ,   t )   Propagate the particle  p  for given time  t , changing appropriately the the  p.pos  and  p.vel  fields.  For a  Particle  the propagation is a straight line (i.e. velocity vector is constant). For a  MagneticParticle  the propagation is circular motion with cyclic frequency  p.omega  and radius  1/p.omega .  source  #  DynamicalBilliards.evolve!     Function .  evolve!(p::AbstractParticle, bt::Vector{Obstacle}, t [, ray_splitter])  Evolve the given particle  p  inside the billiard table  bt . If  t  is of type  Float64 , evolve for as much time as  t . If however  t  is of type  Int , evolve for as many collisions as  t .  Return the states of the particle between collisions.  The evolution takes into account the particle's Type. E.g. if  typeof(p) == MagneticParticle  then magnetic evolution will take place.  Calling  Call the function like:  t ,   poss ,   vels   [,   \u03c9 ] *   =   evolve! ( p ,   bt ,   t )   (see \"Returns\" section for more)  To get the position, velocity and time timeseries from the above output, use the function  construct :  xt, yt, vxt, vyt, ts = construct(evolve!(p, bt, ttotal)...)  Returns  As noted by the \"!\" at the end of the function, it changes its argument  p  (particle). Most importantly however, this function also returns the main output expected by a billiard system. This output is a tuple of 3 (or 4) vectors:   ct::Vector{Float64}  : Collision times.  poss::Vector{SVector{2}}  : Positions during collisions.  vels::Vector{SVector{2}})  : Velocities  exactly after  the collisions.  \u03c9 , either  Float64  or  Vector{Float64}  : Angular velocity(/ies).   In the case of straight propagation, only the first 3 are returned. In the case of magnetic propagation, the 4th value is returned as well. This is either the angular velocity of the particle ( Float64 ), or in the case of ray-splitting it is a vector of the angular velocities at each time step ( Vector ).  The time  ct[i]  is the time necessary to reach state  poss[i+1], vels[i+1]  starting from the state  poss[i], vels[i] . That is why  ct[1]  is always 0 since  poss[1], vels[1]  are the initial conditions. The angular velocity  \u03c9[i]  is the one the particle has while propagating from state  poss[i], vels[i]  to  i+1 .  Notice that at any point, the velocity vector  vels[i]  is the one obtained  after  the specular reflection of the (i-1)th collision. The function  construct  takes that into account.  Ray-splitting billiards  To implement ray-splitting, the  evolve!()  function is supplemented with a fourth argument,  ray_splitter::Dict{Int, Any} , which maps integers to some kind of Function container (Tuple or Vector). The functions in this container are: (\u03c6 is the angle of incidence)   T(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) : Transmission probability.  \u03b8(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) : Transmission (aka refraction) angle.  \u03c9_new(\u03c9, pflag) : Angular velocity after transmission.   For more information and instructions on defining these functions please visit the official documentation.  source  #  DynamicalBilliards.construct     Function .  construct ( ct ,   poss ,   vels [,   \u03c9 ][,   dt = 0.01 ])   Given the main output of this package (see  evolve!()  function) construct the timeseries of the position and velocity, as well as the time vector.  In case of not given \u03c9 (or \u03c9 == 0), straight construction takes place. In case of \u03c9 != 0 or \u03c9::Vector{Real} magnetic construction takes place.  The additional optional argument of  dt  (only valid for Magnetic construction) is the timestep with which the timeseries are constructed.  Calling  Call this function like:  # Straight propagation:  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   ts   =   construct ( ct ,   poss ,   vels )  # Magnetic propagation:  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   ts   =   construct ( ct ,   poss ,   vels ,   \u03c9 ,   dt )  # Any-kind-of propagation (skip dt for straight):  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   ts   =   construct ( evolve! ( p ,   bt ,   ttotal [,   ray_splitter ]) ... ,   dt )   There is no difference in the  construct  call for Ray-Splitting billiards if one uses the awesome ellipsis operator of Julia. The reason for that is that  evolve!()  also returns the vector of angular velocities when necessary.  Returns  A tuple of the following:   xt::Vector{Float64} : x position time-series  yt::Vector{Float64} : y position time-series  vxt::Vector{Float64} : x velocity time-series  vyt::Vector{Float64} : y velocity time-series  ts::Vector{Float64} : Continuous time vector   source",

There are numerous actions performed internally such that the particle propagation is accurate (bounded by \nFloat64\n precision of course), and will not result in any kind of unexpected behavior, like for example particle leakage. Of course, this is a direct trade-off in the expense of speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Splitting Functions\n\n\nIf \nT\n is the transmission probability function, then the condition for transmission is simply: \nT(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) \n rand()\n. If it returns \ntrue\n, transmission (i.e. ray-splitting) will happen. As it has already been discussed in the \nRay-Splitting tutorial\n, the condition of total internal reflection must be taken care of by the user.\n\n\nThe \nthree key functions\n given to the \nray-splitter\n dictionary must have some properties in order to have physical meaning, like for example that the scattering probability function is even towards \u03c6. One of these properties is absolutely \nmandatory\n for this package to work properly. This is the property of total internal reflection, i.e. if the refraction angle is calculated to be greater/equal than \u03c0/2, no transmission can happen. \nThis condition is not assured internally\n and therefore you must be sure that your transmission probability function satisfies it. In the above example, the function \nT\n makes sure to return 0 in that case.\n\n\nIn order to test if the \nraysplitter\n dictionary you have defined has physical meaning, the function \nisphysical()\n is provided:\n\n\n    \nisphysical\n(\nraysplitter\n::\nDict\n{\nInt\n,\n \nAny\n};\n \nonly_mandatory\n \n=\n \nfalse\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn \ntrue\n if the given ray-splitting dictionary has physically plausible properties.\n\n\nSpecifically, check if (\u03c6 is the incidence angle, \u03b8 the refraction angle):\n\n\n\n\nCritical angle means total reflection: If \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2265 \u03c0/2 then T(\u03c6) = 0\n\n\nTransmission probability is even function: T(\u03c6) \u2248 T(-\u03c6) at \u03c9 = 0\n\n\nRefraction angle is odd function: \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2248 -\u03b8(-\u03c6) at \u03c9 = 0\n\n\nRay reversal is true: \u03b8(\u03b8(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9), !pflag, \u03c9) \u2248 \u03c6\n\n\nMagnetic conservation is true: (\u03c9_new(\u03c9_new(\u03c9, pflag), !pflag) \u2248 \u03c9\n\n\n\n\nThe first property is mandatory and must hold for correct propagation. The above tests are done for all possible combinations of arguments.\n\n\nThey keyword \nonly_mandatory\n notes whether the rest of the properties should be tested or not.\n\n\n\n\nPinned Particles\n\n\nIn the case of propagation with magnetic field, a particle may be \"pinned\" (collision-less): There are no possible collisions that take place and the particle will revolve in circles forever. This can happen for specific initial conditions depending on your billiard table and the angular velocity \u03c9.\n\n\nIn such event, the convention followed by \nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n is the following: \nevolve!()\n returns the expected output, however all returned vectors have only 2 entries. The collision times always have the entries \n0.0, Inf\n. All other returned vectors have the initial conditions, repeated once.\n\n\nevolve!()\n can be given an additional \ntrue\n optional argument in the case of magnetic propagation. If you are using ray-splitting it is the 5th argument, otherwise it is the 4th argument. This optional argument throws a \nwarn()\n message whenever a pinned particle is evolved.\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nconstruct()\n\n\nWhen using the syntax \nconstruct(evolve!(p, bt, t)...)\n be sure that there aren't any pinned particles given to evolve. If there are any, construct will result in an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVelocity measure\n\n\nBoth \nParticle\n and \nMagneticParticle\n are assumed to \nalways\n have a velocity vector of measure 1 during evolution. This simplifies the formulas used internally to a significant amount.\n\n\nHowever, during ray-splitting, the a \nMagneticParticle\n may be in areas with different angular velocities (result of the \n\u03c9_new\n function). Physically, in such a situation, the velocity measure of the particle could also change. This change depends on the forces acting on the particle (e.g. magnetic field) as well as the relation of the momentum with the velocity (functional type of kinetic energy).\n\n\nIn any case, such a change is not accounted for internally by \nDynamicalBilliards\n. However it is very easy to implement this by \"re-normalizing\" the angular velocities you use.
